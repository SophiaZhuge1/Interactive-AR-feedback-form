# Augmented Reality Feedback Experience
### Gamifying the feedback collecting process for businesses usiing AR technology. 
Collecting feedback is crucial because listening to what society really need could drive the the direction of any customer centric businesses in the future. 
However, current feedback system is very ineffective, since filling out the feedback form is a tedious process and doesnâ€™t add any value to the customer, most people click through the answers as fast as possible without even look at the question, which just generated a large amount of unnecessary and inaccurate data. 
Now we are proposing a brand new feedback system by using AR to gamify the process so that customers are entertained while providing valuable feedback.
